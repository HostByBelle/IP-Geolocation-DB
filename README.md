# IP Geolocation DB

This repository automatically builds IP geolocation databases in the `.mmdb` database format for both IPv4 and IPv6.
Building is handled via the [mmdbmeld](https://github.com/safing/mmdbmeld) golang package and the database sources originate from [ip-location-db](https://github.com/sapics/ip-location-db).

## Automation

These databases are automatically updated daily at 12:00â€¯AM UTC. That may or may not match the schedule for the upstream sources and as such it is possible these databases may be slightly out of date.

Effort has gone into making these workflows efficient for all parties involved. If you see an inefficiency or issue in the automation process, feel free to report it.

### Release Retention

This repository is configured to automatically delete releases older than 30 days. For this reason, you should always use the appropriate link which points to the latest release. In the event that releases stop running for whatever reason, the latest release will always be preserved regardless.

## Variants

These URLs will always point to the latest version of the database.
